# Belly_Project

This project we used Plotly, D3.json() to vizualize the data as well as parse data in JSON format, using JavaScript to create and deploy interactive charts to GitHub Pages. 

After partially completed dashboard where we could display quick summary from the required  element of the json file, we now need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer, therefore we created a graphic dashboard. Specifically, we added a chart for the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers belly buttons through a couple of charts.
