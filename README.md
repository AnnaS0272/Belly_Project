# Belly_Project

This project used javascript and html to analyze and vizualize the data.

After partially completed dashboard where we could display quick summary from the required  element of the json file, we now need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer, therefore we created a graphic dashboard. Specifically, we added a chart for the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers belly buttons through a couple of charts.
